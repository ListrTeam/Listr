The shell of the initial web page is an Angular COMPONENT named AppComponent
Components are the fundamental building blocks of Angular applications

You'll find the implementation of the shell AppComponent distributed over three files:
app.component.ts— the component class code, written in TypeScript.
app.component.html— the component template, written in HTML.
app.component.css— the component's private CSS styles.
